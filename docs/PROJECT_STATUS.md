   - Resolve ApiKeyAuthentication attribute errors
   - Ensure proper API key validation
   - Fix ambiguous method calls

2. 🔜 Run the test scripts:
   - Generate test files
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Measure performance baselines

3. 🔜 Implement error handling improvements:
   - Add more specific error messages
   - Implement proper exception logging
   - Add diagnostic information to responses

### Medium-term Tasks
1. 🔜 Enhance security:
   - Implement proper rate limiting
   - Add IP-based restrictions (optional)
   - Set up secure API key storage

2. 🔜 Add monitoring:
   - Set up Application Insights
   - Configure custom metrics
   - Create monitoring dashboard

3. 🔜 Optimize for production:
   - Fine-tune memory usage
   - Optimize Speech Service integration
   - Add caching for frequent operations

### Long-term Tasks
1. 🔜 Extend functionality:
   - Add support for more audio formats
   - Implement audio effects processing
   - Add language translation for transcripts

2. 🔜 Scale for higher volume:
   - Configure auto-scaling
   - Implement queuing for large workloads
   - Set up geographic distribution

3. 🔜 Add advanced features:
   - Speaker identification
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Custom speech recognition models

## Known Issues
1. ❗ ApiKeyAuthenticationAttribute implementation needs fixing
2. ❗ Memory usage may be high for very large audio files
3. ❗ Speech recognition quality varies by audio quality and language
4. ❗ No automated tests implemented yet
